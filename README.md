### How to play the game

***
  - To play this game you have to play with 2 or less player.
  - The player 1 wil go first to roll the dice
  - If the dice is more than 1 it will automatically incremented your current score according to the number you obtained from rolling the dice, otherwise if you get dice number 1 it will automatically reset your current score to 0 and then it will switch the player and so forth.
